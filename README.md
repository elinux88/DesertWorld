# DesertWorld
tModLoader mod that makes generated worlds mostly desert

From the mod browser description:

Desert World is a pretty dry mod. You probably wouldn't like it. Especially if you don't like sand.
 
Why? Because it changes almost all naturally occurring blocks into sand and other blocks from the desert biome. Dirt is now sand. Snow is now sand. Stone is now sandstone. etc.. No jungle, no corruption, no green leafy forests. Luckily the oceans survived because they were already made of sand.
 
Think of it as a challenge. How do you make your morning breakfast with only cactus and sand? (I don't know please tell me)
 
This only changes the world when it is created. You can disable this mod after making your world because it won't do anything for you.
